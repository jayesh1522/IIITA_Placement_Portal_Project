<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
This is a JAVA APP named Segment Tree 🌳 Visualizer. This app shows the building visualization of Segment Tree thorugh animation for some added functions like Sum, Max, Min and Xor. I have also added query feature which accepts l and r integer values (indices between which query has to be processed (0 based index)) to show how query works on Segment Tree using animation  and the highlighted nodes at last of query indicates these/this nodes/node are from which answer came (of which query is called ie, min,max,sum,xor).
